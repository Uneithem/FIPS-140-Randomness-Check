# FIPS-140-Randomness-Check

In this program several FIPS standarts are used in order to determine if generated bit sequence is random or not
Test examples:

String generated by pythom pseudo random number generator
string = ''
for i in range(0, 20000):
    string += str(random.randint(0, 1))
Output:
MonobyteTest: True
MaxBitLen: True
Poker Test: True
Series Length: True
Conclusion: Python pseudo random number generator passed all the test written in this program

String generated by random pseudo random number generated, however, it has bias as 0 is twice as more likely than 1
string1 = ''
for i in range(0, 20000):
    string1 += str(random.randint(0, 2) % 2)
Output:
MonobyteTest: False
MaxBitLen: True
Poker Test: False
Series Length: False
Conclusion: Max series length failed to determine that sequence is not purely random and biased, other three tests have succeded

This string is entirely not random as after each 0 1 can be found and vice versa
string2 = '0'
for i in range(1,20000):
    if string2[i - 1] == '0':
        string2 += '1'
    else:
        string2 += '0'
Output:
MonobyteTest: True
MaxBitLen: True
Poker Test: False
Series Length: False
Conclusion: it's predictable that monbyte test and max length of series test would fail, other two have succeded though

This test example was specifically designed to fail all test, it's obviously not random
string3 = ''
while (len(string3))<=20000:
    string3 += '000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010101010101010101'
Output:
MonobyteTest: False
MaxBitLen: False
Poker Test: False
Series Length: False
Conclusion: as it was intended, all test have failed

In summary, the more tests are used in order to find if string is random, the better as only one of them can easily fail
